# Hi

``` Terminal
npm install my-fancy-ultrainnovative-demo-package
``

package contains a function hiThere(), which console logs a message from me.

```.js
require("my-fancy-ultrainnovative-demo-package").hiThere();

or 

const demo = require("my-fancy-ultrainnovative-demo-package");
demo.hiThere();
```

```
node filename.js
```
